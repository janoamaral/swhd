# swhd (Simple Windows Hotkey Daemon).

[Suckless philosophy](https://suckless.org/philosophy/)

> Ingenious ideas are simple. Ingenious software is simple. Simplicity is the heart of the Unix philosophy. The more code lines you have removed, the more progress you have made. As the number of lines of code in your software shrinks, the more skilled you have become and the less your software sucks.

`swhd` registers global hotkeys and then executes a program when the key combination is pressed.
